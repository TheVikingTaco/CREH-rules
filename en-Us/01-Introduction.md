# Introduction

The objectives of this rulset are: to promote good technique, good defense and creativity of the participant. Not only is it intended that fighters can connect with their opponent without being hit in the process, but also, it is intended that fighters can execute the cuts and techniques in an appropriate manner, with appropriate form and control and the creativity of the participant is encouraged by not using a graduated score.

This tournament is not intended to simulate a “real fight”, but rather, to be another tool with which to measure and test our tactical and technical knowledge.
